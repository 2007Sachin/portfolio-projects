This is a Python code that uses various packages to analyze data related to the movie industry.

The packages used in this project are:

pandas: used for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: used for scientific computing and working with arrays
seaborn: used for data visualization
matplotlib: used for creating various types of plots and charts
The code is analyzing a dataset related to the movie industry. The dataset contains information about various movies, including their budgets, gross earnings, release dates, and other details.
The first part of the code checks for any missing data in the dataset and fills in the missing values with the mean of that particular column. It also changes the data type of the 'budget' and 'gross' columns to integer and creates a new column called 'year_correct' that extracts the year from the 'released' column.

The dataset is then sorted by 'gross' earnings in descending order and any duplicate rows are removed.

The code then creates a scatter plot and a regression plot to visualize the relationship between 'budget' and 'gross' earnings.

The correlation matrix is also calculated using the Spearman correlation method and visualized using a heatmap. The correlation matrix shows the correlation between all numeric features in the dataset.

The code also converts all object data types to categorical codes so that they can be used in correlation analysis.

Finally, the correlation pairs are sorted and it is concluded that 'votes' and 'budget' have the highest correlation to 'gross' earnings, while 'company' has a low correlation.

I hope this helps you understand the code! Let me know if you have any further questions.
